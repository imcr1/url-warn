## Path-based URL Matching

URL Warning supports granular control with path-based matching:

```
# Examples:
example.com/malware      # Blocks only this specific path
wiki.archlinux.org/title/VPN_over_SSH  # Blocks this specific article
```

This allows you to block specific content while keeping the rest of the domain accessible.

## API Integration

URL Warning can fetch blacklists and whitelists from remote endpoints:

```
https://nerd.bh/apis/warnme/blacklist.json
https://nerd.bh/apis/warnme/whitelist.json
```

The expected format is a JSON array of objects with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "site": "example.com",
    "reason": "Known phishing site",
    "alternatives": ["safe-example.com", "alternative.org"]
  },
  {
    "site": "malware.com/specific-path",
    "reason": "Contains malware"
  }
]
```
